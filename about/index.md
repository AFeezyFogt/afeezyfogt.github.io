I'm Austin. I'm a reader, teller of stories, husband to Karis, theology nerd, and coffee fanatic. Also, I have a beard that my wife assures me will not ever be gone. 

I'm profoundly interested in people and their stories. I find that when you know someone's story, empathy becomes natural. Something I try to keep in mind.
