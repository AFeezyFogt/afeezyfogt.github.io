A little about me, I'm a subdeacon and work with the teens at my [parish](http://www.stantonytulsa.com), growth guy at [Compose](https://www.compose.io), I cowork at [The Workshop at Made](http://www.theworkshopatmade.com), help the wife with her line of housewares and fine art at [weather&noise](http://www.weatherandnoise.com), run the [Made Shops](http://www.shopatmade.com) and organize [Indie Emporium](http://www.indieemporium.com).
