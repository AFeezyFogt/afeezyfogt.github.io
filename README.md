This is my personal blog built with [Jekyll](http://github.com/pekyll).

What will you find here? My random ramblings on things like theology, learning to code, cooking, beer, books and...well, you get the point. If you want to know more about how this is built, check out the original Mediator [Readme.md](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator)
